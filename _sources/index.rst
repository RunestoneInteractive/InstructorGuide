Using eBooks with Runestone Interactive
=======================================

If you are an instructor wanting to learn more about how to use the `Runestone Academy <https://runestone.academy>`_ website, then this is the resource for you.
The Runestone platform allows you to create, modify, use, and serve interactive ebooks. This instructors guide was built  using the Runestone platform.

With Runestone you can:

* Use any of the existing ebooks that are listed at the following link `here <https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/index>`_.
* Create a private course for your students as shown in the following Video and Chapter 4 of this guide.  Your course will have to have a unique name and your students can register for the course using the unique name.

:::::::::::::::::::::::

Runestone uses the ``restructuredText`` (rst) markup language.  We chose this over markdown largely because rst is extensible.  Nearly all of the basic markup tasks are already handled by restructuredText.  You should check out the docs for the basics of restructuredText (link below). Our extensions are all for the interactive elements.  One key hint about restructuredText:  Its like **Python** -- *indentation matters!*
