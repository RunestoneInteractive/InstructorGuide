View Student Activity
=====================

Many actions that students take are logged. These include:

* Loading a book page
* Answering a multiple choice question
* Running code in an ActiveCode window

The instructor interface lets you see summaries of some of these activities that may be useful to you. To get started, from the instructor interface, click on the *Student Progress* tab.

Some elements of this tab are promising but not quite ready for prime time; they are on our agenda for future development. There are two elements, however, that may already be of some use to you.

1. If you have assigned students to read a particular chapter prior to (or after) class, you can see at a glance what percentage of them have looked at each of the pages in a chapter. In the upper right hand corner, you can select a chapter. Then look at the left side.

2. You can see how students did on the multiple choice problems in the chapter.  Some instructors have found it useful to focus in class on those questions where many students got the question wrong initially. Currently, the interface sorts the questions in order of the percentage of students who got them right the first time, so you may want to scroll down to find the ones they had trouble with.
