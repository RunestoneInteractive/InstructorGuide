Invite Students to Register
===========================

Sometimes teachers ask how they can register their students for the custom courses they are running. We do not have a procedure for teachers to register students. Instead, students register themselves.

When you created the custom course, you chose a project name. Give that text string to students. They will register on the site and enter that string as their course name. If you've forgotten what the string is, you can see it displayed on the Course selection page `<http://interactivepython.org/runestone/default/courses>`_.  You can access that page by clicking on the person icon and selecting *Change Course*.

.. note:: Students will register for a custom course following the same procedures that were described :ref:`earlier in this book <registration_chap>`. You just need to provide them with the text string for the course name.
