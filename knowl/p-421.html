<div class="para">I realize that students will often complain that they had their work done on time but the darn Runestone would not give them credit.  Usually they are wrong.  But you have several ways of checking out their claim including downloading the log for your course or looking at the Student Activity report and checking their first and last interactions with the problem. The software has proven itself to be correct way more often than the students and we use one of the most reliable databases in the world (Postgresql) to keep track of student activities!</div>
