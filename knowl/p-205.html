<div class="para">If the previous instructor is not available then we can still probably make it happen, but you are going to have to go out of your way to prove that your request is legit.  Sorry, we cannot just take your word for it over email.  A link to your faculty page, that verifies your email as a legitimate instructor at the same institution of the instructor of the course you want to copy.  We would love to just trust everyone, but data privacy laws are strict and we have to to treat data privacy very carefully.  Thanks for understanding.</div>
