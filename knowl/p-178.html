<div class="para">There are two primary kinds of assignments. <dfn class="terminology">Reading Assignments</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Problems Sets.</dfn> Reading assignments allow you to select whole chapters or parts of chapters for your students to read. You can assign points to the reading assignment by tracking the number of activities they attempt in each subchapter. Problem sets are mainly for you to select short programming problems for the students to solve, but could also include short answer, multiple choice, etc. Or even problems that you write yourself. More on that later.</div>
