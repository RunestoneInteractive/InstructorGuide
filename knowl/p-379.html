<li><div class="para">Make sure your students are logged in to YOUR course and not the open course that you based yours on. If your student is logged in to your course they will see the name of your course in the upper left corner of the browser window.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Make sure they are paying attention to the progress bar. If the progress bar is gray they are not logged in! If it is green they are. The progress bar will show how many of their activities have been recorded for that page.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Check the assignment page and click on the self grade button. This is yet another way that students can verify their work has been saved.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For students work to show up in the gradebook you will need to use the grading interface to run the autograder which tabulates the scores for the assignment and saves them in the database. You also need to release the grades in order for the students to see them on the student progress page. If you havenâ€™t released them then they will not see their progress.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Make sure your assignment deadlines are set up correctly or that you have unchecked the box to only count activities before the deadline.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">From the student progress page you can click on the name of any student and see the raw log details. You can also click on the overview reports link from that page and download a CSV file that you can import into your favorite spreadsheet. This will show you counts of activities for each student, the timestamp of the first time a student interacts with anything in runestone and more.</div></li>
