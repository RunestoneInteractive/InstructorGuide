<div class="para">Building a system like Runestone is a lot of work, and I am amazed at what we have accomplished with very little funding.  The future looks very exciting Runestone Academy has incorporated and is operating as a non-profit.  We have applied for and are waiting approval of the formal 501(c)(3) tax status with the IRS. I am hopeful that I will be able to announce some significant support from an NSF program designed to help open source projects like Runestone and PreTeXt become sustainable long term.  I think I did a pretty good job of outlining our vision in <a href="Introduction.html#prose-philosophy" class="internal" title="Section 1.1: The Runestone Philosophy">SectionÂ 1.1</a> . We have an exciting and necessary mission and if you are inspired to help us out in any way we would welcome your efforts!</div>
