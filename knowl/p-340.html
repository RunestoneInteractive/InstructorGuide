<div class="para">We use the Github issue tracker extensively for proposing and discussing new features as well as for reporting and investigating bugs. This is the place to report problems. Github is well known and trusted and it is free to sign up. <em class="emphasis">Please do not use personal email to report problems</em>.</div>

<li><div class="para">It is not that we do not like to engage with people one-on-one it is simply a matter of trying to optimize our time. Many many bug reports are duplicates, for which there are already documented workarounds on Github if you just take the time to search.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Part of being an open source project is that we do our work in the open, and try to leverage the efforts and knowledge of the entire community. Sending a personal email to me may be satisfying or easy for you, but in many cases there are others who can help and fix the problem just as fast or faster than I can.</div></li>
