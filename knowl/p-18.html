<div class="para">As you will see in our history, Runestone came out of a small liberal arts college.  Class sizes were around 30 students.  A huge number of our courses are high school AP CS courses using the CSAwesome book.  Those courses tend to be in the 10 -- 50 student range.  For courses that size Runestone has worked well for many years. In fact here is a histogram of course sizes over the last two years.</div>
