<div class="para">When reporting a problem please please take the time to give us some context and some details. Telling me that X does not work doesn’t really help. The truth is runestone.academy gets over 500,000 page views a day from people around the world. So most of the time when someone says “X does not work” it does in fact work fine for most people. This does not make it your fault, it just means I need more information to try to make sense of what is going on. Here are a few tips.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">What Task are you trying to accomplish? Understanding your goals is really important as sometimes its not obvious how to do something on Runestone</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What steps did you take to try to accomplish that task? Walking me through the steps gives me valuable context and saves me TONS of time in trying to recreate what went wrong.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Specifically what went wrong? What error message did you see? What exactly did happen that you think should not have happened. You can speculate about what you think is broken, but often you will be wrong and misleading. Just the facts is a great policy.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Give some context about your environment. What course are you in? What is your username? What page of the course? Specifically what exercise does not work? Each activity has a unique identifier. please include that. What browser are you using? What version of the browser. (Runestone relies on many modern features of Javascript that are only present in new-ish browsers) We can not test every browser so if you are using something outside of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or maybe Edge it is likely that I have not tested it there.</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">If there is a traceback on the page, please copy it and include it in your Github Issue. Many many errors can be quickly diagnosed from the Javascript Console error log.</div>
