<div class="para">Of special note is the checkbox just above the submit button. This says that you would like to support Runestone at the rate of $10 / student from your department or school. This is totally VOLUNTARY! If you check the box you will get an invoice from us about a week after the starting date you entered for your course. If you canâ€™t pay or do not wish to pay simply do not check the box. It is fine either way, but we would love your support if you are able.</div>
