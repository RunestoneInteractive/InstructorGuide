</h4>If you are from an institution that has classes of 1000+ then I would ask that you really make an effort to support Runestone Academy.   Either directly from your department, or stating on your syllabus that students should donate. Please recognize that a course of 1000+ puts a lot of additional demand on our servers. We strive to give you a great experience so as more students register we add more servers.  Every server we add costs money. In the future we may be forced to institute a small fee for very large courses just to help us cover our costs.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="Introduction.html#li-14" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
