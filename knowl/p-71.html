<div class="para">You may also have noticed the "Remove Student(s)" button in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reg_your_students_fig.html" title="Figure 4.1.2">FigureÂ 4.1.2</a> This allows you to remove a student from your course.  Although it seems self explanatory the reason to bring this up is to explain what happens to the student account when you remove them.  The account is <em class="emphasis">not</em> deleted but rather the student and their work is moved to the base course.  This allows a student to have access to their work and to continue working independently if they wish.  As an instructor you do not have the capability to delete a student account.  But anyone can delete their account and all of the information saved for that account by using the ðŸ‘¤ menu choosing edit profile.</div>
