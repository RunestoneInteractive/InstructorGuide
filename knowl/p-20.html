<div class="para">We have architected the website to be horizontally scalable.  Which means we can support many thousands of courses at the same time.  So, we can support many thousands of courses, but not many thousands of students in a single course.  We are working on that, but it is a big job.  The good news is that the parts that suffer are the parts for the instructor interface.  The student experience is not affected.  So, if you are teaching a course of 1000+ students, your students will not notice any problems.  But you will.  Further good news, the instructor interface is undergoing a major rewrite, so know that we are working on it, and are now aware that 1000+ student courses are a thing.</div>
