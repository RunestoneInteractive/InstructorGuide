<div class="para">Of special note is the checkbox just above the submit button. This says that you would like to support Runestone at the rate of $10 / student from your department or school. This is totally VOLUNTARY! If you check the box you will get an invoice from us about a week after the starting date you entered for your course. If you can’t pay or do not wish to pay simply do not check the box. It is fine either way, but we would love your support if you are able.</div>
