<div class="para">How often have you had a student ask you how they could get more practice? One theory that supports this is “spaced repetition” That is, a method to have students go back and answer existing questions but a couple of weeks after the material was brand new. Its harder, because its now out of the immediate context of the reading they just did, but this type of review helps solidify a student’s understanding of the concept.</div>
