<div class="para">Very well thank you!  Every student interaction is logged to the runestone database using UTC time.  When you create an assignment with a deadline store the time in the timezone of the instructor making the assignment as the deadline.  Given that we can fairly judge whether a student has completed their work on time.  Trust me we have figured this out over the years and learned a lot about time zones.  Did you know there are places in the world where there are half or quarter hour differences between two timezones??!!</div>
