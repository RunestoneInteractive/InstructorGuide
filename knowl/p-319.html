<div class="para">Most instructors start out using Runestone Academy and one of the books we provide pretty much as is. As you get used to using Runestone and get comfortable with its ways and quirks you may find yourself wanting to add new questions to your course. After that you may find yourself wondering about how you might customize some of the courses content. Or you may find yourself wanted to add some functionality to the instructors interface. These are all great things and we welcome that evolution of your involvement. You should not feel like you have to be an expert author or coder to contribute. Its actually very enjoyable to see people continue their learning journey by helping develop the platform that helped them start!</div>
