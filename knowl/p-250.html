<div class="para">If you want to grade your peer instruction assignment you must set up your questions correctly.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">You must set the Auto-Grade column to either <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Peer</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Peer+Chat</code>.  Setting this column to Peer will give the student credit if they have answered both vote1 and vote2.  Setting it to Peer+Chat will give them credit if they have voted for vote1, interacted with their parter(s) through chat, and voted in vote2.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Which to grade field must be set to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">All Answers</code> This is because peer assignment grading is unique in that the student is getting credit based on multiple interactions with a question not just a single check for correctness.</div></li>
