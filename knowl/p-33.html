<div class="para">Things got even more interesting in the Spring of 2018 when I was offered a consulting gig with Google.  They wanted to use Runestone as a platform for their applied computing program.  In a nutshell the programâ€™s goals were to introduce computer science to colleges with underserved student populations that had not offered computer science before.  I basically got to work on Runestone and coach professors from the participating colleges in how to use Runestone and how to teach introductory CS.  The program expanded into a second course to introduce Data Science to those colleges, which resulted in the <em class="emphasis">How to Think like a Data Scientist</em> book.  My gig at Google was supposed to last 5 months, but it ended up lasting two years.</div>
