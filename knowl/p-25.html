<div class="para">The next several years were super busy, I managed to find money to get Luther students to work with me on Runestone during the summer months.  In the summer of 2014 we had the first Runestone Hackathon at the University of Michigan.  This workshop was pivotal because it was the beginning of the instructor interface.  I had always resisted adding too many instructor facing features to Runestone,  I did not want Runestone to become another crappy LMS!! But Paul Resnick and Barb Ericson convinced me that adding features to make the lives of instructors better was necessary, and that we could do things that LMS could never dream of doing to help teachers understand their students better.  We did a lot of whiteboard designing that year and worked on it until it all really came together in the summer of 2016 when we had the second hackathon at Luther College.</div>
