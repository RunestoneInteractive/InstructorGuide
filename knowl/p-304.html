<div class="para">The implementation of Runestone is “opinionated” that is, it is informed by my own expereiences and preferences as a teacher, as well as the experiences and preferences of some core contributors. It is difficult for a system like this to be all things to all people without imploding on itself under the weight of a thousand different configuration options that make many things possible, but almost nothing good, and nobody happy. It may not work the way you think it should but over the years it has proven do be able to do most of what people really want. So maybe give it a chance.</div>
