<div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Writing an instructor guide that contains all of the answers to the questions essentially doubles the work of writing a book, and even more so maintaining the book. In all the textbooks I’ve used over the years for CS I’ve only ever had one that had a solution guide and that was largely for all of the math in a networking text.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For 99% of the questions there is no one right answer. Very likely if I give you an answer there is a better one out there, and I really don’t want to get into arguments about what is better. Especially since a lot of it comes down to style.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Doing the work is the best way to prepare to teach it. You are smarter, wiser, and a better problem solver than your students. Its actually good for them to see how you approach solving the problem rather consulting some answer key.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">From a practical perspective it would be very hard for me to decide who gets the materials. How do I know you are an instructor? I can’t possibly take the time to go check out every user that claims to be an instructor to see if they are legit. Right now the only benefit of being an instructor is that you get to see and grade the work of your students. If you are a student pretending to be an instructor this gives you no advantage.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">As I think about how best to invest the hours of my day that I have to work on this, I have very little energy or excitement for writing an answer key. So I choose to spend my time elsewhere. If others were to do so, and want to publish it somehow, I would be very happy to accept a PR!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">I wold much rather put my energy into developing good unit tests, so that you know when you are right and when you are not there yet without me giving you solution.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">With all of that, behind me, I’m still thinking about it, and trying to find a way to do it where its NOT a huge amount of extra work, and I can keep things in sync. I’ve thought about charging for the instructor guide as one way to both disuade casual cheaters and to help fund Runestone development. Stay tuned…</div></li>
