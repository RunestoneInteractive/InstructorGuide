<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Courses that are open to anyone to view without logging in or for anyone to enroll in if they choose to create an account. We call these books <dfn class="terminology">base courses.</dfn> These courses are very large and have no instructor to guide the students, eveyone just proceeds at their own pace.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Smaller courses at a a high school, college, or university, that are guided by an instructor like yourself also use these books. We often refer to these as <dfn class="terminology">custom courses</dfn>
