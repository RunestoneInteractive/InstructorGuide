<div class="para">The choose assignment page shows the status of the assignment. Students are encouraged to use this to keep themselves organized. They can mark an assignment as <dfn class="terminology">in progress</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">submitted</dfn> But marking an assignment as submitted is <em class="emphasis">advisory</em> only. They can continue to work on the assignment and Runestone will continue to record what they do. When you grade the assignment you have the flexibility to decide what to grade and how to grade it. You can enforce your deadlines, or relax your deadlines. You can grade your students best response, their last response or their first.</div>
