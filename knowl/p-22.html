<div class="para">The next problem was to translate our textbook called <em class="emphasis">Python Programming in Context</em> from LaTeX to restructuredText and converting the examples to be runnable.  But Jones and Bartlett publishers had different ideas.  I had signed away the digital rights to the book in our original contract and Jones and Bartlett were not willing to let me convert the book.  They were going to sells PDFs along with some kind of digital code to a code practice system online.  I was really depressed, I loved that book and its approach.  I hated the publisher (and still do) for their greed and short sightedness.  I didn’t want to start over and write yet another intro to CS book from scratch.  So I started looking for something else to start with.  This led me to <a class="external" href="" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">How to Think like a Computer Scientist</code></a> by <a class="external" href="https://www.allendowney.com/wp/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Allen Downey</code></a> and  <a class="external" href="https://www.elkner.net" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Jeffrey Elkner.</code></a> This book at a GNU Free Documentation License, and was alread in restructuredText!!  So I remixed that book and added interactive examples which led to the interactive edition of that book.</div>
