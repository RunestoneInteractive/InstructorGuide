<div class="para">Recently Runestone Academy has become a tool for courses at much larger institutions and consequently we are seeing course sizes grew.  I was totally taken off guard in August of 2023 when three courses containing 1000+ students were created.  To this I would say the following:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A 500+ student course has never been a design point for Runestone.  So, yes, things like the gradebook or student progress tabs, are likely to time out.  The good news is that your students will not notice, it just makes your life difficult! Sorry!  We will work on it.  But also recognize that a course of 1000+ puts a lot of additional demand on our servers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you want to use the practice tool for a very large course then you should definitely set the option to have flashcards generated when a student starts a page or the option for when they complete a page.  If you try to have it generate flashcards for the students when you mark a section as complete you are going to be frustrated!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You may also wish to consider breaking a very large course into multiple courses corresponding to different sections.  You can set up one section as a master and then your TAs can copy assignments from the master course.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you are from an institution that has classes of 1000+ then I would ask that you really make an effort to support Runestone Academy.   Either directly from your department, or stating on your syllabus that students should donate.  In the future we may have to institute a small fee for very large courses.</div></li>
