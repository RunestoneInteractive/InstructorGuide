<div class="para">Since May Â 2020 there has been a standing weekly online gathering of PreTeXt and Runestone authors and developers. It runs on Friday afternoons for three hours and is announced Friday mornings on the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pretext-announce</code> Google Group. Sometimes there are scheduled discussions on development topics or seminars on topics of interest to authors and developers; but mostly there is no agenda and no schedule. Come late, leave early, drop-in, drop-out. If you are present, then you are implicitly available to help someone with questions, even if you are working on something yourself. The rest of us may lurk and/or join in. We can use break-out rooms if a subgroup wants to run a discussion, work on a targeted project, or help somebody get started one-on-one. The model is the hotel lobby after dinner at a workshop, but you provide your own contraband.</div>
