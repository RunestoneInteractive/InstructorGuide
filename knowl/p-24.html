<div class="para">In the Summer of 2011 I was at the ACM Awards ceremony in San Jose, I was there as part of the team accepting the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Software_System_Award" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Software System award</code></a> .  At the banquet I started a conversation with Mark Guzdial and Barb Ericson who were accepting the Karl Karlstrom outstanding educator award.  I told them about Runestone and that conversation started a pivotal partnership that has lasted to this day.  Their reaction was this is wonderful and the kind of research tool we have been looking for.  Now can you add multiple choice questions? fill in the blank?  And many many more ideas including Parsons problems, which were the subject of Barb’s PhD research.</div>
