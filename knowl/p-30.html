<div class="para">By the late Fall of 2017 I was developing a real desire to focus all of my efforts on Runestone.  But I wasnâ€™t sure how to make that happen until Luther announced an early retirement incentive. Anyone with 15 years of service to the college was eligible and could get a years salary and stay on the college health plan for five years.  This was a dream come true, I just met the 15 year criteria and the years salary would give me time to figure out how to make Runestone sustainble in a way that could pay me some kind of salary.</div>
