<div class="para">It was early in the afternoon of the first day of the workshop when I found myself in a room with David Farmer, and after I had given a quick demonstration of Runestone and its capabilities he said something like:  “This is great, but I don’t know why you would want to keep developing this Runestone Markup language when you could just use PreTeXt and focus your efforts on other more valuable work.”  It was one of those direct statements that hit me hard, should I be offended? embarrased? honored?  It took me a couple of days and getting to know both David and Rob better to realize the wisdom of that statement.  But by the end of the workshop we were able to host a version of Rob’s book <em class="emphasis">A First Course in Linear Algebra</em> on a Runestone Server.  We also realized that our goals were very well aligned and that we could accomplish more by working together than we could by continuing to work separately.</div>
