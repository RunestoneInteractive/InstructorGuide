<div class="para">In either case the primary way you will add questions is through the tree picker interface.  This interface is accessed by expanding either the Readings or Problems accordion and allows you to drill down from chapter to section to individual problems. There are several icons associated with problems to help you know what you are looking at.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">The 📘 icon indicates that a particular problem was written by the author.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The 🏫 icon indicates that a problem was contributed by another instructor.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The ✔️ icon tells you that the problem can be automatically graded.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">In any case you can click on a problem to see a preview.  If you are previewing a question and it is obviously bad, or incorrect, or just someone experimenting, use the <dfn class="terminology">Flag Question</dfn> button to let us know.  We have volunteer editors that help us clear out or correct these bad questions.</div>
