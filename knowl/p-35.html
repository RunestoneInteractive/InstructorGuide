<div class="para">It took an entire global pandemic for Rob and I to really integrate the Runestone Components into PreTeXt .  And it took me a Summer to cook up a conversion process that turned restructuredText into PreTeXt .  But that explains why this instructor guide looks a bit different than the Runestone books you may be used to seeing.  I converted the instructor guide to PreTeXt and have been working on adding it and making it more useful.  What you see in this book is a little glimpse of the future.  Whats more is that students really benefit from this partnership.  Books in PreTeXt are far more accessible than anything we have done with restructuredText and they are far more mobile ready as well.</div>
