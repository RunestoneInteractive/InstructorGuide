<div class="para">I didnâ€™t know anything about <abbr class="acronym">AIM</abbr>, and I had never met Oscar but the workshop sounded interesting. So I said yes. When I arrived at the first day of the workshop and listened to the introductory talk, I knew that I had found a group of people I wanted to work with more.  Many of the people in this workshop were authors of open source math textbooks written in <a class="external" href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">PreTeXt</code></a> .  A project started by Rob Beezer at about the same time I had started Runestone.</div>
