<div class="para">The Runestone project began in on my sabbatical in 2011.  Iâ€™ve already mentioned that I had serious writers block because I wanted computer science textbooks to be interactive.  The first stage in fixing that problem was finding a way to run Python in the browser.  This led me to the <a class="external" href="https://skulpt.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Skulpt Project</code></a> Scottie Graham had implemented Python 2.6-ish by re-implementing CPython in Javascript.  While the core was there Skulpt was missing many pieces, such as a turtle graphics module.  Since I loved using turtle graphics as a way for students to get fun, immediate feedback on their code I set about trying to add turtle graphics to skulpt.  Since I knew very little about Javascript that sucked up a couple of months of my Sabbatical, but was a lot more fun than updating a textbook.  With turtle graphics in hand I knew I had hit on something!</div>
