<div class="para">If you are teaching a course of 500+ students here are some things to keep in mind:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Things like the gradebook or student progress tabs, are likely to time out (502 Gateway timeout). The grader itself is probably something you should start when you can just let it run for an hour or more.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you want to use the practice tool for a very large course then you should definitely set the option to have flashcards generated when a student starts a page or the option for when they complete a page.  If you try to have it generate flashcards for the students when you mark a section as complete you are going to be frustrated!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You may also wish to consider breaking a very large course into multiple courses corresponding to different sections.  You can set up one section as a master and then your TAs can copy assignments from the master course.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you are from an institution that has classes of 1000+ then I would ask that you really make an effort to support Runestone Academy.   Either directly from your department, or stating on your syllabus that students should donate. Please recognize that a course of 1000+ puts a lot of additional demand on our servers. We strive to give you a great experience so as more students register we add more servers.  Every server we add costs money. In the future we may be forced to institute a small fee for very large courses just to help us cover our costs.</div></li>
