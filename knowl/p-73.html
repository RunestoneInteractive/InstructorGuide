<div class="para">You may be get around some of these problems by asking your school to allow mail from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">runestoneinteractive@gmail.com</code> to go through.  If your IT department is not cooperative then your students will have to come to you to have their password changed.  You can reset the password for any of the students in your course.  Just select the student from the list and click the reset password button.  I cannot respond to emails asking me to reset passwords, I donâ€™t have the time to do that, and I do not have a reliable way to verify that those requests are legitimate.  Yes many high schoolers think it is funny to try to trick me into resetting the password on one of their friends.</div>
