          <p>To create an assignment, whether graded or ungraded, start by going to the Assignments
            tab on the instructor interface. Click on the Add button to start creating a new
            assignment. On the popup that appears you will notice that you can also copy an old
            assignment as a starting point.</p>

    <p>There are two primary kinds of assignments. <term>Reading Assignments</term> and <term>Problems
      Sets.</term> Reading assignments allow you to select whole chapters or parts of chapters for
      your students to read. You can assign points to the reading assignment by tracking the number
      of activities they attempt in each subchapter. Problem sets are mainly for you to select short
      programming problems for the students to solve, but could also include short answer, multiple
      choice, etc. Or even problems that you write yourself. More on that later.</p>
    <p>In either case the primary way you will add questions is through the tree picker interface.
      This interface is accessed by expanding either the Readings or Problems accordion and allows
      you to drill down from chapter to section to individual problems. There are several icons
      associated with problems to help you know what you are looking at. <ul>
        <li>The üìò icon indicates that a particular problem was written by the author.</li>
        <li>The üè´ icon indicates that a problem was contributed by another instructor.</li>
        <li>The ‚úîÔ∏è icon tells you that the problem can be automatically graded.</li>
      </ul> In
      any case you can click on a problem to see a preview. If you are previewing a question and it
      is obviously bad, or incorrect, or just someone experimenting, use the <term>Flag Question</term>
      button to let us know. We have volunteer editors that help us clear out or correct these bad
      questions. </p>

  <subsection xml:id="instructor-interface_creating-a-reading-assignment">
    <title>Creating a Reading Assignment</title>
    <p>Let's create a reading assignment and add a few sections for our students to read. As you add
      sections you will see that are shown in a table under the Readings tab.</p>
    <image source="Figures/reading_assignment.png" width="50%" />
    <p>There are four things you can change for each section:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p># required - How many of the components on the page do you students need to do in order
            to get the points for this section.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How many points for completing this section?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Auto-grade - interaction means that the students have done something</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>which to grade - first answer, best answer, or last answer</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="instructor-interface_creating-a-problem-assignment">
    <title>Creating a Problem Assignment</title>
    <p>Creating a problem assignment is similar. You will most often use the tree picker, but you
      can also search for problems or write your own. When selecting a problem if you click on the
      name of the problem the interface will display the problem on the page remind you what it is
      about.</p>
    <image source="Figures/problem_selection.png" width="50%" />
    <p>Problems have a different set of configurations</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Points - how many points for this question</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Auto-grade &#x2013; options here are % correct, All or nothing, Interaction, or manual.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>which to grade &#x2013; Best Answer, first answer or last answer</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Problems with the book icon next to them are written by the author. Problems with the
      schoolhouse are contributed by the community. If a problem has a checkmark next to it then you
      know it can be automatically graded.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-accommodations">
    <title>Accommodations</title>
    <p>Runestone allows you to create accommodations for students who need them. You can create an
      accommodation for a student by clicking on the accommodations menu item in the assignment
      builder, or use the link from the course home page. There are three kinds of accommodations
      that you can create: <ul>
        <li>Extra Time on Timed Assessments</li>
        <li>Extended Due Date</li>
        <li>Allow student to see/access assignments not visible to others</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <figure
      xml:id="accommodations-builder">
      <caption>Creating Accommodations</caption>
      <image source="Figures/accommodations.png" width="75%" />
    </figure>
    <subsubsection
      xml:id="subsubsec-ExamTime">
      <title>Extra Exam Time</title>
      <p>When you create an accommodation for extra time on timed assessments, you can specify a
        multiplier for the extra time that the student will receive. Normally this is something like
        1.5 or 2.0 for the student. This extra time will be
        added to the time limit for any timed assessments that the student takes. The student will
        see the extra time on the exam page.</p>
      <p>You can set this accommodation for a specific student or for a group of students. If you
        set it for a group of students, then all students in that group will receive the extra
        time. If you set it for a specific student, then only that student will receive the extra
        time. You can set it once by just selecting one or more students and setting the multiplier
        value. This will then apply to ALL assignments. It can be ovverridden for a specific
        assignment at any time, as a specific assignment will take priority over the general
        accommodation.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection
      xml:id="subsubsec-extended-due-date">
      <title>Extended Due Date</title>
      <p>When you create an accommodation for an extended due date, you specify the number of
        extra days that the student will have to complete the assignment. This can be set for a
        specific student or for a group of students. If you set it for a group of students, then all
        students in that group will receive the extra time. If you set it for a specific student,
        then
        only that student will receive the extra time. You can set it once by just selecting one or
        more students and setting the number of extra days. This will then apply to ALL assignments.
        It can be ovverridden for a specific assignment at any time, as a specific assignment will
        take priority over the general accommodation.
      </p>
      <p>If you need to grant a further extension, you can do so by creating a new accommodation
        with more days. If you gave them 3 days at first, but that wasn't enough, you can enter 5
        days
        to give them an additional 2 days.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection
      xml:id="subsubsec-visibility">
      <title>Visibility</title>
      <p>This is for situations where the assignment is not visible to the students, but you would
        like to mail the student a link to an exam, maybe a makeup exam. Or an extra assignment, or
        whatver. This accommodation requires both a student and an assignment. When the
        accommodation
        is saved, then the assignment will show up for the student in their assignment list, or you
        can email the student a link to the assignment and they will have access.</p>
