  <title>Copying Assignments</title>

    <title>Copying from your previous courses</title>
    <p>You may have multiple sections where you want to share assignments, or you may simply want to copy your assignments from the last time you taught a course to your current course.  Choose "Copy Assignment" from the Instructor Dashboard under the "Assignments &amp; Grading" menu. Before copying assignments, it is a good idea to make sure that the course settings has the correct start date in the "Course Settings" in the "Course Administration" menu of the Instructor Dashboard so that the due dates are adjusted properly.</p>

    <p>At the copy assignment page, select any of your old or current courses that use the same book or the base course if the author has created base course assignments.</p>
    
    <p>Once the course is selected you can copy one or all of the assignments to your course.  If you do this multiple times courses with the same name will be ignored on the second copy.  This makes it a little easier if you just want to keep one course in sync with another so you don't have to remember and pick and choose.</p>

    <p>The system will add the assignments to your current course and make its best guess to adjust the due date, based on the number of days from the beginning of each course set in the Course Settings in the "Course Administration" menu of the Instructor Dashboard.  This is going to get you in the ballpark, but you will probably have to manually adjust it due to differences in the calendar from year to year.</p>

    <title>Copying Base Course Assignments from the Author</title>
    <p>Some authors have provided a pre-made set of assignments.  You can copy these from the "base course" after you have created your course.  The "base course" is the code for the book that you chose when you created your own course.  Not all authors have done this yet, so your results will vary.</p>

    <title>Copying from a different Instructor</title>
    <p>Help, this is my first time teaching this class and I want to copy assignments from another instructor.  This is very possible if the instructor is still available.  You simply need to enroll in their course and have them make you a TA.  Then you will be able to copy the assignments from their course to yours.</p>
    <p>If the previous instructor is not available then we can still probably make it happen, but you are going to have to go out of your way to prove that your request is legit.  Sorry, we cannot just take your word for it over email.  A link to your faculty page, that verifies your email as a legitimate instructor at the same institution of the instructor of the course you want to copy.  We would love to just trust everyone, but data privacy laws are strict and we have to to treat data privacy very carefully.  Thanks for understanding.</p>
