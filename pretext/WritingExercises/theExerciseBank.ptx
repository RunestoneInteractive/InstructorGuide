    <p>The new Assignment Builder makes it easy to write your own exercises! Although all of the Runestone books have a pretty good selection of exercises, you can never have too many exercises. We hope to crowd source an enormous collection of questions and problems in our Exercise database. You can help by adding custom exercises for your own course to the database! Once your exercise is in the database, it is available for others to find using the search feature on the create assignment page. Community contributed exercises are shown with a person icon instead of a book icon under the source column.</p>

    <p>To create new exercises, start or go to any assignment in the Instructor Dashboard "Assignment Builder". In the Exercises section of the assignment, click on "Add Exercise" and select "+ Create New Exercise". </p>

<p>There are many different types of exercises that you can create as shown below. Some of these are discussed further in the sections below.</p>

 <p>Here are some examples of these different types of exercises. In the next pages, we will go through the steps to create some of these exercises.</p>  

  <p>Here is an example Multiple Choice Exercise:</p>
  <exercise label="java_mcq_1">
    <statement>
      <p>What does the following code print?</p>
      <program language="java">
        <code>
System.out.println(2 + 3 * 5 - 1);
        </code>
      </program>
    </statement>

    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>24</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            This would be true if it was System.out.println(((2 + 3) * 5) - 1),
            but without the parentheses the multiplication is done first.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>14</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            This would be true if it was System.out.println(2 + (3 * (5 - 1))),
            but without the parentheses the multiplication is done first and the
            addition and subtraction are handled from left to right.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>This will give a compile time error.</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            This will compile and run. Try it in DrJava. Look up operator
            precedence in Java.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>16</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            Correct! Remember PEMDAS. The multiplication is done first (3 * 5 = 15) and then the addition (2 + 15 = 17) and finally the subtraction (17 - 1 = 16).
          </p>

      </choice>

  <p>Parsons (Mixed up Code) Problem:</p>
   <exercise label="mixed-hi-paired" numbered="yes" adaptive="yes" indentation="hide" language="java">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following has all the correct Java code to print out “Hi there!” when
          the code is run, but the code is mixed up and contains some extra
          blocks with errors. Drag the needed blocks from left to right and put
          them in the correct order. Click on the “Check Me” button to check
          your solution.
