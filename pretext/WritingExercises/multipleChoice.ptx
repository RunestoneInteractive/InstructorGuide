  <title>Multiple Choice Questions</title>
  <p>A common question type is the multiple choice question like below.</p>
  
  <exercise label="java_mcq_2">
    <statement>
      <p>What does the following code print?</p>
      <program language="java">
        <code>
System.out.println(2 + 3 * 5 - 1);
        </code>
      </program>
    </statement>

    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>24</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            This would be true if it was System.out.println(((2 + 3) * 5) - 1),
            but without the parentheses the multiplication is done first.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>14</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            This would be true if it was System.out.println(2 + (3 * (5 - 1))),
            but without the parentheses the multiplication is done first and the
            addition and subtraction are handled from left to right.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>This will give a compile time error.</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            This will compile and run. Try it in DrJava. Look up operator
            precedence in Java.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>16</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            Correct! Remember PEMDAS. The multiplication is done first (3 * 5 = 15) and then the addition (2 + 15 = 17) and finally the subtraction (17 - 1 = 16).

  <p>Click on Next or 3 to move to the Settings tab. Here you can set the chapter and section where you want the exercise stored in the assignment builder (where it will show when browsing chapters in the assignment builder), the author, the topic, the number of points for the question, and add tags to help you find the question later. If you change the name of the exercise, make sure it is unique! Some authors put their author names in the exercise name too to make them easier to find. You can also choose to make the exercise private or contribute it to the question bank for other teachers to use. Please make experimental questions private. </p>

  <p>Make sure that you Preview the exercise in step 4 and test it before saving it. Although there is no way to delete an exercise once it is saved, you can always edit it later to fix mistakes, make it private, or flag it for the volunteers to fix or delete.</p>
